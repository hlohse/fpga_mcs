binary image in bram, e.g. 100x100
occupancy < 5% => 500 active pixels/image

pattern resolution: 100 * 60 = 6000
100 rams 64x6 in parallel

LUT: 100*6 bit = 600 bit = 20*32 bit

Per pixel 20 DRAM read cycles, matches occupancy

Potential optimization using wider histogram memory (sequential operation)

After image, parallel readout of 100 histo rams (60 cycles), with parallel thresholding

(Buffer results in FIFO)

Peak finding on results
